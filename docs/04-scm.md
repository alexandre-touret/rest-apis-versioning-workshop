# Configuration management

## Preamble
You can configure your services either during deployment using CI tooling or any other Infra As Code tool ( Istio, Ansible,...) or using a configuration server.
For this workshop, all the configuration items will be provided by [Spring Cloud Config](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/docs/current/reference/html/#_quick_start).

We will illustrate in this chapter the impacts of versioning in the configuration management.
